# Basic Time-in/Time-Out webpage with basic admin control
This was the very first project in collaboration with Mark Joseph Mendiola during my time in College. It was the very first programming related group activity that required me to act as a lead. A lot of the systems/code is very crude with how a lot of it is written in raw PHP so expect a lot of
unreadable code when loading in.
